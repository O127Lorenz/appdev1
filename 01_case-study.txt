Case Study
Managing a Challenging Cross-Department Collaboration

As a software manager, I oversee a development team that handles various projects. Recently, another department approached me with a request for a joint effort. They were seeking help from our software engineers to support their team in the Research and Development (R&D) department, as they were facing tight deadlines. The challenge was clear: the R&D department needed assistance to meet their target dates, and we had to step in and assist, despite the fact that there was a significant learning curve involved.

Although the schedule was already very tight, we decided to lend our support to help them meet their goals. Despite the initial challenges, the collaboration showed promising progress. However, as we were nearing the end of the project and approaching the target deadline, one of my developers faced a personal family crisis, which unfortunately disrupted our progress and further jeopardised our ability to meet the deadline.

Questions for Consideration:

As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects the project timeline? What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate with both the client and your team?

As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?

What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?

Case Study

1.As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects the project timeline? What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate with both the client and your team?

-As a manager, you need to consider the employees that you handle and have empathy for them because what happened to him is really bad and you need to put some considerations for him. After that, you should assess the unfinished task that he left and get some help from the teams in your company that don't have much work. Also report it to the R&D department (or client) about the situation as soon as possible in order to discuss potential adjustments to the timeline or scope. Lastly, the manager needs to come up with new project management plans in order to quickly identify critical path tasks that might need additional support in such situations.

2.As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?

- As the developer, you should communicate with the manager in the new project management plans in order to come up with clear communication on what you realistically can or cannot do and what you can realistically accomplish given the situation. After assessing the parts of the projects and having a clear new timeline for them, the developers that are assigned for this task should work as early as possible and work strictly in order to accomplish the task according to the new given timeline.

3.What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?

- The managers should be more active in checking if the team that he handles can properly do their task, in order to do that, he could check the timeline and critical path
